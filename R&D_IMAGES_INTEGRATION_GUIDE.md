# ✅ R&D Images Integration Complete!

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished

### ✅ **Code Updates:**
1. **Updated ProcessFlow.tsx** - Added directory mapping for your R&D images
2. **Updated ServiceDetails.tsx** - Changed to use JPG format for main images
3. **Created setup script** - Automated image file preparation

### ✅ **Image Integration:**
1. **Main Service Image** - `service-hero.jpg` ready in main directory
2. **All 9 Process Steps** - Each step now has `step-hero.jpg` 
3. **Correct File Paths** - Components now point to your generated images

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If Images Don't Display:**

#### **Check File Names:**
- Ensure `step-hero.jpg` exists in each step directory
- Ensure `service-hero.jpg` exists in main directory

#### **Check File Formats:**
- Website expects `.jpg` files (not `.png`)
- Use the setup script if you need to convert formats

#### **Check Browser Cache:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Clear browser cache if needed

#### **Check Console Errors:**
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Look for 404 errors in Console tab
- Check Network tab for failed image requests

## 🎨 Image Quality Tips

### **For Best Results:**
1. **Resolution**: Ensure images are high quality (1920x1080 for main, 1280x720 for steps)
2. **File Size**: Optimize for web (aim for <500KB per image)
3. **Format**: JPG format works best for photographs
4. **Consistency**: Maintain similar lighting and style across all images

### **If You Want to Update Images:**
1. Replace the `.jpg` files in the respective directories
2. Keep the same file names (`service-hero.jpg`, `step-hero.jpg`)
3. Refresh your browser to see changes

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **For Other Services:**
1. **Generate images** using the prompts in `AI_IMAGE_PROMPTS.md`
2. **Follow the same structure** - create directories matching the service names
3. **Use the same file names** - `service-hero.jpg` and `step-hero.jpg`
4. **Update components** if needed for different directory structures

### **For Enhanced Experience:**
1. **Add more detail images** - Create additional images for each step
2. **Optimize file sizes** - Compress images for faster loading
3. **Add alt text** - Improve accessibility with descriptive alt text
4. **Consider animations** - Add subtle hover effects or transitions
