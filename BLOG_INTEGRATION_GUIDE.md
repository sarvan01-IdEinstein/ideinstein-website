# Blog Integration Guide for IdEinstein

## Overview
This guide will help you set up a complete blog system for your IdEinstein website using Markdown files and Next.js.

## What We'll Build
- Individual blog post pages
- Markdown file support for easy writing
- Automatic blog post listing
- SEO-friendly URLs
- Image support for blog posts

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Create Blog Content Structure
```
/content/
  /blog/
    /2024/
      /01/
        - future-of-3d-printing.md
        - cad-modeling-best-practices.md
      /02/
        - engineering-trends-2024.md
```

### 2. Blog Post Format (Markdown with Frontmatter)
Each blog post will be a `.md` file with metadata at the top:

```markdown
---
title: "The Future of 3D Printing in Manufacturing"
excerpt: "Exploring how additive manufacturing is revolutionizing the industry..."
date: "2024-01-15"
category: "Technology"
tags: ["3D Printing", "Manufacturing", "Innovation"]
image: "/images/blog/3d-printing.jpg"
author: "IdEinstein Team"
readTime: "5 min read"
---

# The Future of 3D Printing in Manufacturing

Your blog content goes here...
```

### 3. Required Dependencies
We'll need to install some packages to handle Markdown:
```bash
npm install gray-matter remark remark-html
```

### 4. File Structure We'll Create
- `/content/blog/` - Your blog post files
- `/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` - Individual blog post pages
- `/lib/blog.ts` - Functions to read and process blog posts
- `/components/blog/` - Blog-specific components

## Benefits of This Approach
