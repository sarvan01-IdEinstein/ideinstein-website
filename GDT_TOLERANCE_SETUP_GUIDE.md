## 🔧 **If Process Images Don't Display:**

### **Check Browser Console:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Look for 404 errors in Console tab
3. Check Network tab for failed image requests

### **Verify Image Paths:**
The system should construct paths like:
```
/images/services/engineering/gdt-tolerance/process/GT-1-design-review/step-hero.jpg
/images/services/engineering/gdt-tolerance/process/GT-2-manufacturing-method/step-hero.jpg
...etc
```

### **Clear Browser Cache:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Clear browser cache completely
