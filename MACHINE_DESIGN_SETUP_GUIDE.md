## 🔧 **If Process Images Still Don't Display:**

### **Check Browser Console:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Look for 404 errors in Console tab
3. Check Network tab for failed image requests

### **Verify Image Paths:**
The system should now construct paths like:
```
/images/services/engineering/machine-design/process/MD-1-requirements-analysis/step-hero.jpg
/images/services/engineering/machine-design/process/MD-2-safety-assessment/step-hero.jpg
...etc
```

### **Clear Browser Cache:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Clear browser cache completely

---

## 🎉 **Success Indicators:**

### **✅ You Should See:**
- Machine design facility hero image displaying correctly
- All 8 process step images showing in the interactive flow
- Smooth navigation between steps with your AI-generated images
- Professional, contextual imagery for each machine design step
- No broken image placeholders or 404 errors

### **✅ Interactive Features Working:**
- Click any step number (1-8) to jump to that step
- Use arrow buttons to navigate sequentially
- Visual progress bar showing current step
- Hover effects and smooth animations
- Both desktop and mobile responsive design
