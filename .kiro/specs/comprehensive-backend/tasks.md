## Implementation Notes

### Development Best Practices

- Follow test-driven development (TDD) approach for all new features
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for all integrations
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Follow security best practices for all API endpoints and data handling
- Implement proper database migrations and rollback procedures

### Integration Considerations

- All Zoho integrations must handle API rate limits and failures gracefully
- File upload system must support resume capability for large files
- Payment processing must be PCI compliant and secure
- All third-party integrations must have proper error handling and fallbacks

### Performance Requirements

- API endpoints must respond within 1 second for 95% of requests
- File upload system must handle concurrent uploads efficiently
- Database queries must be optimized with proper indexing
- Frontend must achieve Lighthouse scores >90 for performance

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the IdEinstein platform with clear, actionable tasks that build incrementally toward the complete system while maintaining focus on the strategic "build vs buy" approach.
