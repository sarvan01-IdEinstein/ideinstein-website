# IdEinstein Backend Requirements - Final Specification

## Overview

This document defines the final requirements for the IdEinstein backend system, implementing a professional engineering services platform with PostgreSQL caching, RBAC security, and comprehensive Zoho One integration.

**Status**: Current and Active
**Last Updated**: January 2025
**Implementation Phase**: Ready for Development

## Strategic Approach: Build vs Buy Decision

### Core Principle

**Build**: Customer-facing portal and unique intellectual property that differentiates our business
**Buy**: All internal operations, admin functions, and standard business processes using Zoho One suite

### Key Benefits

- **Speed to Market**: Launch MVP in 8 weeks instead of 18+ weeks
- **Reduced Complexity**: Focus on customer experience, not internal tooling
- **Lower Risk**: Leverage proven enterprise software for business operations
- **Capital Efficiency**: Minimize custom development costs and maintenance overhead
- **Scalability**: Enterprise-grade business operations from day one

## Revised Phased Development Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Target: 8 Weeks)

**Goal**: Launch core customer transaction loop and validate market demand

**Core Functionality**:

- Customer signs up, creates project, uploads CAD files
- Receives manually-generated quote, pays one-time invoice
- Tracks high-level project status
- Deep integration with Zoho One suite (CRM, Projects, Books)

**Key Principle**: Build ONLY the customer-facing portal. All internal operations managed within Zoho. NO custom admin dashboard. NO in-browser CAD viewer in this phase.

### Phase 2: Growth & Enhancement (Target: Weeks 9-16)

**Goal**: Enhance core user experience based on paying customer feedback

**Core Functionality**:

- In-browser 3D CAD preview via Autodesk Platform Services
- Real-time customer chat (Intercom/Zoho Desk)
- Subscription-based services via Zoho Books
- Expanded API integrations for new features

### Phase 3: Scale & Intelligence (Target: Weeks 17-24+)

**Goal**: Optimize operations and introduce data-driven features at scale

**Core Functionality**:

- Evaluate custom admin interface if Zoho limitations become bottleneck
- AI/ML-driven project insights and recommendations
- Advanced observability stack (DataDog, Jaeger)
- Performance optimizations for increased load

## Revised Technology Stack (Build vs Buy)

### Core Infrastructure (Build - Customer Portal)

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: NestJS for core API and integration logic
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (app-specific data only)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT tokens and Google OAuth

### Business Operations (Buy - Zoho One Suite)

- **CRM & Admin Hub**: Zoho One Suite (CRM, Projects, Analytics)
- **Payment Processing**: Zoho Books (integrating with Stripe/PayPal)
- **Email Service**: AWS SES (Transactional), Zoho Campaigns (Marketing)
- **Real-time Customer Chat**: Intercom or Zoho Desk
- **Business Intelligence**: Zoho Analytics with custom dashboards

### CI/CD & Monitoring (Initial Phase)

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and deployments
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for real-time error monitoring
- **Basic Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch for infrastructure monitoring
- **Secret Management**: GitHub Actions secrets and environment variables

### Phase 2+ Additions

- **3D CAD Preview**: Autodesk Platform Services (third-party integration)
- **Advanced Monitoring**: DataDog + Jaeger (if scale demands it)
- **Performance Optimization**: Redis caching (if needed)
- **Custom Admin**: Only if Zoho limitations become significant bottleneck
