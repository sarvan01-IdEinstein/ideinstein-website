# ðŸš€ Zoho Bypass Solution - Get Backend Working Now

## ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Solution: Mock Zoho Integration**

2. **See the customer portal** with sample data
3. **Verify all functionality** works
4. **Replace with real Zoho** later when OAuth is resolved

I'll create a mock service that returns sample data instead of making real API calls.
